<p align="center">The goal of the project is to create a database for a fitness club that will enable effective management of clients, memberships, classes, trainers, equipment, and feedback. The database is designed to support the daily operations of the club, such as client registration, membership management, class reservations, attendance tracking, and equipment maintenance. The database should also enable data analysis and report generation to support business decisions.
